# FCC-Cat-And-Dog-Image-Classifier
This repository, as a part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python course introduced me to implementing my own Convolutional Neural Network. Inside you will the code which classifies images of dogs and cats. I used TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time.
